            <p><h2>Summary</h2>Currently working as template designer(page-maker/make up men/HTML code). I have some experience both in the process of self-development and in the process of working on projects. However, I try to develop and learn programming languages. I believe page-making is the beginning of the journey in the IT field. I want to study different directions and try myself not only as a front-end developer. The immediate goal is to become an integral expert with sufficient knowledge to carry out large interesting projects. I try hard to develop my skills in page-making, and learn JS, Angular, Golang.</p>
